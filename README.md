# Python-Project2
This project involves analyzing the "Lung Capacity" dataset to explore the relationship between lung capacity and height through statistical and regression modeling. The analysis begins with a descriptive statistical summary of the dataset, including summary tables and frequency plots for key variables, LungCap and Height. Following this, three polynomial regression models are developed to capture the relationship between these variables with increasing complexity.


This project aims to perform a thorough descriptive statistical analysis, fit and compare regression models, and provide quantitative and visual insights into the relationship between lung capacity and height. Concluding remarks are based on the statistical significance of the models and their visual representations, offering a comprehensive understanding of the findings.
